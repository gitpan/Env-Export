	* lib/Env/Export.pm
	* t/15_no_redefine.t (deleted)

	* t/30_prefix.t (added)
	* t/40_all.t (added)
	* t/50_warn.t (added)
	* t/60_override.t (added)
	* t/70_link.t (added)
	* t/80_split.t (added)
	* t/sub_count.pl (added)
	Added extensive new features and loads more tests. Better       
	overall model for how the args list is processed into a series  
	of newly-defined functions. The keywords ":all",                
	":prefix"/":noprefix", ":warn"/":nowarn",                       
	":override"/":nooverride", ":link"/":nolink" and ":split" are   
	now all implemented. Shell-style globbing patterns are          
	acceptable as an alternative to regular expressions.            
	Documentation extensively re-worked to cover all of this, and   
	tests galore for all of these features.                         

	* t/10_basic.t
	* t/15_no_redefine.t
	Bring tests more in line with nature of the module.

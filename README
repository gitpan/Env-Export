Env::Export - Export environment variables as constant subroutines
==================================================================

Version: 0.22


WHAT IS IT
----------

This module allows the user to specify one or more environment variables that
should be "exported" to the calling namespace as constant subroutines. By
doing this, their existence/inexistence can be detected at compile-time.


USING Env::Export
-----------------

The difference is in how you detect the absence of the environment variable
you need:

    if (exists($ENV{PATH}) and ($ENV{PATH} =~ /.../))
    {
        # Do something
    }

versus:

    use Env::Export 'PATH';

    if (PATH =~ /.../)
    {
        # Do something
    }

The first form performs two tests, the first to ensure that the second does
not cause a "Use of unitialized value in regular expression" warning. The
second form only performs one test, but it also generates a compile-time
error if there was no environment variable "PATH" present.


BUILDING/INSTALLING
-------------------

This package provides a Makefile.PL file as is typical of CPAN modules.
Building and installing is as easy as:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        # If tests pass
        make install

(The "make install" step may require super-user privileges.)
